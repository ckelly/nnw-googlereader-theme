A Google Reader Theme for NetNewsWire
===================================================

In celebration of NetNewsWire 3.2 Beta gaining Google Reader Sync support, 
I created a quick theme that mimics the Google Reader content area.

### Installation ###

Theoretically you should be able to double click the GR09.nnwstyle file and it should install into NNW. 

if this doesn't work, copy/ move the GR09.nnwstyle file to the following directory:

`~/Library/Application Support/NetNewsWire/StyleSheets/

After that, just select the "GR09" Theme from the drop down and you're good to go!

### Known Issues ###

There is no theme for combined view, as combined view themeing is not fully supported.
